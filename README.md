## Contribute

This plugin was initially written by a third-party contractor ([Bleujour](https://www.bleujour.com/)/[Infopolis](https://www.infopolis.fr/)), and is now maintained by the Utrust development team.

We have now opened it to the world so that the community using this plugin may have the chance of shaping its development.

You can contribute by simply letting us know your suggestions or any problems that you find [by opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/utrustdev/utrust-for-prestashop/issues/new).

You can also fork the repository on GitHub and open a pull request for the `master` branch with your missing features and/or bug fixes.
Please make sure the new code follows the same style and conventions as already written code.
Our team is eager to welcome new contributors into the mix :blush:.

### Development

If you want to get your hands dirty and make your own changes to the Utrust for PrestaShop plugin, we recommend you to install it in a local PrestaShop store (either directly on your computer or using a virtual host) so you can make the changes in a controlled environment.
Alternatively, you can also do it in a PrestaShop online store that you have for testing/staging.

Once the plugin is installed in your store, the source code should be in `modules/UTRUST`. All the changes there should be reflected live in the store.
When you add a translation string like `l s='This is phrase' mod='UTRUST'` it should automatically appear in "Admin dashboard" -> "Localization" -> "Translations" -> "Modify Translations" (section) and choose the Type of translation "Installed modules translations" and the desired language. Search for Utrust and make the changes. Once you save, it will store the translations in Utrust module code (folder `translations`).
f something goes wrong, logs can be found in `/log`.
